## 🎯 Project Overview

**CyberShield – Password Strength & Entropy Analyzer** is a **portfolio demonstration project** created specifically for **technical recruiters and hiring managers**.  
It showcases how a **security-focused password analysis tool** can be architected, implemented, and presented using **modern web technologies** and cybersecurity best practices.

This application is **not intended for production use** and **does not store or manage real user credentials**.  
All password input is processed transiently for analysis only.

The project demonstrates:

- Secure authentication flows for protected analysis features  
- Password strength evaluation using **entropy-based calculations**  
- Detection of weak, predictable, or high-risk password patterns  
- Security-aware frontend–backend communication  
- Clear, explainable security logic suitable for review and audit  

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Secure Authentication Demo
- JWT-based authentication flow  
- Password hashing using industry-standard practices (bcrypt)  
- Role-based access simulation (Admin / Analyst)  

### 🔑 Password Strength & Entropy Analyzer
- Password complexity checks (length, character diversity, predictability)  
- Entropy calculation to estimate resistance against brute-force attacks  
- Real-time feedback for weak or risky password patterns  
- Visual strength indicators (weak / moderate / strong)  
- Secure handling of sensitive input without persistence  

### 📊 Analysis History (Demo)
- Simulated analysis history panel to demonstrate persistent UI patterns  
- Clickable history items that load detailed analysis views  
- Emphasis on explainability rather than data retention  

> All passwords and analysis data are **mock or transient** and used strictly for demonstration purposes.

## 🔒 Security Focus

- Cryptographic hashing for password protection  
- Entropy-based password strength evaluation  
- Secure API communication and input validation  
- Clear separation between frontend presentation and backend logic

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|------|--------------|
| **Frontend** | React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic |
| **Security** | JWT authentication, bcrypt |
| **Dev Tools** | ESLint, TypeScript strict mode |

## 🧠 Project Intent

CyberShield is designed to help reviewers understand:

- How password security can be evaluated beyond basic rules  
- How entropy is used to assess password strength  
- How sensitive user input should be handled securely  
- How cybersecurity concepts translate into user-facing feedback
