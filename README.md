## 🎯 Project Overview

CyberShield is a **portfolio demonstration project** created specifically for **technical recruiters and hiring managers**.  
It showcases how a real-world cybersecurity dashboard can be architected, implemented, and presented using modern web technologies.

This application is **not intended for production use** and **does not manage recruitment processes**.  
Instead, it demonstrates:

- Secure authentication flows  
- Cybersecurity-oriented UI and dashboard patterns  
- Log analysis and password evaluation concepts  
- Clean frontend–backend integration  

### Key Highlights

- Modern React architecture using TypeScript and modular components  
- Python FastAPI backend with structured, secure endpoints  
- Cybersecurity-inspired dashboard design (monitoring, alerts, status panels)  
- Core security fundamentals such as JWT authentication and password hashing  

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Secure Authentication Demo
- JWT-based authentication flow  
- Password hashing using industry-standard practices  
- Role-based access simulation (Admin / Analyst)  

### 🔑 Password Evaluation Tool
- Password complexity and strength checks  
- Real-time feedback for weak or risky patterns  
- Demonstrates security-aware form handling and validation  

### 📊 Log & Activity Analysis Demo
- Log input and analysis interface  
- Visual severity indicators (normal / warning states)  
- Historical scan panel to demonstrate persistent UI patterns  
- Clickable history items that load detailed views  

> All data is mock or simulated for demonstration purposes.
